Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots was a student project, a collaboration among myself, <a href="http://www.macherie-edwards.com/" target="_blank">MaCherie Edwards</a>, and <a href="http://roseheydt.tumblr.com/">Rose Heydt</a> for CS 349: Games. It's our interpretation of the Flaming Lips' album of the same name: the story of a girl named Yoshimi tasked with saving the world from killer robots. The game allows players to experience the album first-hand from Yoshimi's perspective while the tracks play alongside it.

I wrote all the code for the game. MaCherie and Rose designed, created, and animated the sprites and backgrounds. We built the game in approximately two weeks while all maintaining full courseloads. Because of this, it's a little rough, but for two weeks worth of work, I think it's not half bad.
