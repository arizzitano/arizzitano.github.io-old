	<p>I joined the TraceView team (formerly Tracelytics) at AppNeta in February of 2013. TraceView is a full-stack application tracing and monitoring tool. It receives request data from customers' application servers, processes it, and displays actionable insights to customers through a variety of innovative data visualizations.</p>

	<p>TraceView was a uniquely exciting place to work because I learned a TON about customers' architectures. Because we traced various languages, stacks, and frameworks, we needed to research and support numerous different technologies, even ones we didn't use natively, in addition to the tools we used to build our app. I learned about MongoDB when building a query fingerprinter, JVM architecture when graphing JMX host stats, the importance of ntpd when solving distributed hosts' clock skew display issues, and much more.</p>

	<p>I worked on the application team as a full-stack engineer, but did most of my work on the frontend. On the server side, my projects included request trace analysis, MVC development in Pylons, database schema design, a JSON parser/lexer. On the client side, I architected & built autosynced RESTful JS models, designed and built data-heavy visualizations, modularized templates, established a style guide and genericized sitewide CSS. I also did significant design and UX work for new features.</p>
