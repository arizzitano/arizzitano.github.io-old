summary: "Slide deck for a talk I gave at Harvard's Web Working Group about prototyping and building web applications."

[I gave a talk about building web apps](http://harvardwww.com/2012/07/jumpstart-your-web-app/) at Harvard's Web Working Group on Wednesday, July 13. Most of my examples came from Glyphosaurus and the things we learned throughout the development process: working iteratively, locking down requirements, communicating with collaborators, etc. It's the first public talk I've ever given, and although I was pretty nervous at first, I think it went quite well! The audience had a lot of great questions and ideas, and I'm glad to have met all these talented folks.

[My slides are up here](http://www.slideshare.net/harvardwww/jumpstart-your-web-app). Slideshare mangled them a bit, but they're still mostly understandable.

If you haven't been to any Harvard WWW talks yet, I highly encourage you to check them out! The next talk will be by Faras Sadek on Gitorious, September 12 at 3:30. Ping [@harvardwww](http://twitter.com/harvardwww) to RSVP.
