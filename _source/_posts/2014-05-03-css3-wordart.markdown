WordArt was a feature in older versions of Microsoft Office that generated stylized text. Its wide availability and user-friendliness led to broad use (and abuse) in signage, logos, and presentations. The unique presets are immediately recognizable typographic relics of the late 90s/early 00s. CSS3 WordArt allows users to generate WordArt-like text styled with CSS3.
