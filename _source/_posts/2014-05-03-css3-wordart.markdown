        CSS3 WordArt allows users to generate WordArt-like text styled with CSS3. WordArt was a feature in older versions of Microsoft Office that generated stylized text. Its wide availability and user-friendliness led to broad use (and abuse) in signage, logos, and presentations. The unique presets are immediately recognizable typographic relics of the late 90s/early 00s.

        I recreated as much of the original WordArt styles as possible using only CSS (LESS, to make things a little more DRY). This included text background gradients and tiles, 3D effects, shadows, and funky-ass transforms. I also reproduced the original WordArt creation interface using JS and CSS to replicate the experience of selecting, creating, and resizing a piece of WordArt. Due to the experimental nature of the CSS properties used therein, CSS3 WordArt only reliably works in Chrome.
