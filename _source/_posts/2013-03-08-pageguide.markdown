Pageguide.js is a small JS tool for creating flexible, adaptive walkthroughs for web applications. After joining the Tracelyics team at AppNeta, I took over the project, handling feature requests, bug reports, and community contributions. In order to keep the tool current, I significantly overhauled the code to enable dynamic functionality within single-page apps. I also built out a suite of unit tests and benchmarks.
