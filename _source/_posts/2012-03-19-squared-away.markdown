As part of a partnership between Boston College and the US Social Security Administration, Upstatement was commissioned to create Squared Away, a series of calculators, articles, graphs, and checklists to help people make sound financial decisions.

Most of my work on Squared Away was on the calculators and graphs. We did not use any charting libraries (yeah, I know, not my decision), so the charts are constructed entirely using JS and CSS. User input is passed through predictive economic models to help users visualize their finances and plan for the future. Additionally, I helped build the site itself using PHP, wrote a search interface using Sphinx, and styled pages responsively using SASS.
