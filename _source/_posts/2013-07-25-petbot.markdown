PETBOT is a low-budget telepresence robot I built for the AppNeta office, consisting of an iPad mounted on a lightweight chassis powered by a toy RC car. To move PETBOT, users control it from a web UI using the arrow keys. Its low latency, long battery life, and especially the flashing police light make PETBOT a fun and easy way for remote employees to telecommute into the office.

The car is controlled by a radio transmitter wired to a Raspberry Pi running a local node.js server. Commands are sent via socket.io through the web UI & second node.js server hosted remotely on Heroku. The local server connects to the remote server as a socket.io client, thus allowing commands to be sent to the Pi from anywhere in the world with very low latency.
