I spoke at the Boston Node.js Meetup at Bocoup in fall 2013 about how I built PETBOT, and how other people could construct similar nodebots. Most of the talk focused on the challenges of running Node on a Raspberry Pi and the utility of websockets for real-time communications. I also gave a quick overview of TBone.js, AppNeta's in-house JS framework, and how I used it to sync PETBOT's state across multiple servers.

PETBOT only crashed into the wall once, BTW.
