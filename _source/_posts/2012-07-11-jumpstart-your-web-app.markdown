I gave a general audience talk at Harvard's Web Working Group about how to plan, design, build, test, and launch a basic web application. I stressed iterative development and collaboration among developers, designers, and product folks, using examples from Upstatement's development of Glyphosaurus. The slides got a little mangled on Slideshare, but they're still (mostly) understandable.
