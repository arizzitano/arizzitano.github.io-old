8-bit art is a proud tradition at AppNeta, from our chat emoticons to our open-source logos. To pay tribute, as well as to keep clueless visitors from accidentally roaming around our office, I decided to make an 8-bit sign. First, I converted the logo to an 8-bit design. Then, inspired by the dimensional artwork of <a href="http://daigh.com/" target="_blank">Eric Daigh</a>, I constructed the sign from pushpins.

I used over 3000 pushpins. The hardest part was matching available pushpin colors to the logo's brand guideline colors. Also, keeping my cat from eating the pushpins. Also, hanging it. We used spare ethernet cable looped around the pipes in the office.
