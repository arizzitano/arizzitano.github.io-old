simple-share is a small jQuery plugin that uses icon fonts in conjunction with social media sites' unpublished share URLs to create simple, elegant, unobtrusive share buttons and links. Most of Upstatement's clients requested social sharing buttons for their websites, but they didn't like the out-of-the-box buttons provided by those services. Thus, we ended up creating our own assets for share buttons, which was wasteful. Furthermore, I ended up digging for the services' share URLs so I could reproduce the native buttons' functionality. simple-share helped eliminate some of this frustration.
