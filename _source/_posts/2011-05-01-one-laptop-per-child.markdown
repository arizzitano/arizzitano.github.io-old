Upstatement helped One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) update, build out, and improve its web presence to reflect its humanitarian efforts to provide laptops to children in developing countries. As part of the overhaul, I built out a number of interactive animations, including an SVG map (using Raphael.js) of the countries served by OLPC.
